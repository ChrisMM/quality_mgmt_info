## :globe_with_meridians: Highlights from Wikipedia articles on Software Quality Management and Testing

### 1. Quality Management

_From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management_

Quality management ensures that an organization, product or service is consistent.

Quality management has **four main components**:

- quality planning,
- quality assurance,
- quality control
- and quality improvement.

#### :raised_hands: It's for both Product and Process

Quality management is focused on **product and service quality**, and also on the **means to achieve it**.

#### :heavy_check_mark: Let's talk Achievement Methods

Quality management, therefore, uses **quality assurance and control of processes** as well as products to achieve more consistent quality.

#### :boom: Improvement along the way

Quality Improvement can be distinguished from Quality Control in that Quality Improvement is the purposeful change of a process to **improve the reliability of achieving an outcome**.

#### :musical_score: QA and QC defined

- **Quality Control** is the ongoing effort to maintain the integrity of a process to maintain the reliability of achieving an outcome.

- **Quality Assurance** is the planned or systematic actions necessary to provide enough confidence that a product or service will satisfy the given requirements.

#### :flashlight: Audits and Reviews

Quality audit is the process of systematic **examination of a quality system** carried out by an internal or external quality auditor or an audit team.

It is an important part of an organization's quality management system.

### 2. Software Quality Assurance

_From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_assurance_

Software Quality Assurance (SQA) encompasses the **entire software development process** including processes such as requirements definition, software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, software configuration management, testing, release management, and product integration.

To ensure quality in a software product, an organization must have a three-prong approach to quality management:

- **Organization-wide** policies, procedures and standards must be established.
- **Project-specific** policies, procedures and standards must be tailored from the organization-wide templates.
- Quality must be controlled; that is, the organization must **ensure that the appropriate procedures are followed** for each project.

### 3. Software Quality Management

_From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality_management_

Software quality management (SQM) is a management process that aims to develop and manage the quality of software in such a way so as to best **ensure the product meets the quality standards expected by the customer** while also meeting process and policy.

- The job is not only to ensure their software is in good shape for the consumer but also to **encourage a culture of quality** throughout the enterprise.

- Software quality management activities are generally split up into three core components: **quality assurance, quality planning, and quality control.**

### 4. Agile Testing

_From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_testing_

Agile testing is a software testing practice that follows the **principles of agile software development**.

- Agile testing involves **all members of a cross-functional agile team**, with special expertise contributed by testers, to ensure delivering the business value desired by the customer at frequent intervals, working at a sustainable pace.

- Agile development recognizes that **testing is not a separate phase**, but an integral part of software development, along with coding.

- Agile teams use a "whole-team" approach to **"baking quality in" to the software product**.

- Testers on agile teams lend their expertise in eliciting examples of **desired behavior from customers**, collaborating with the development team to turn those into executable specifications that guide coding.

- Testing and coding are done incrementally and interactively, building up each feature until it provides enough **value to release to production**.

- Agile testing covers [all types of testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Testing_types,_techniques_and_tactics).

- Regression testing
- Acceptance testing
- Alpha testing
- Beta testing
- Functional and non-functional testing
- Continuous testing
- Destructive testing
- Performance testing
- Usability testing
- Accessibility testing
- Security testing
- Internationalization and localization testing
- Development testing (performed by developers)
