## :white_check_mark: Quality Control Activities and Product Acceptance

For Product Acceptance, we work with Product, Design, and Engineering toward assuring and evaluating (verifying and validating) 
products through modern [Agile QA-Testing](https://blog.testlodge.com/the-role-of-qa-in-agile/) techniques of quality control.

### :telescope: Scoping

_To properly scope and estimate activities of testing on a project, the time allocated to various test preparation 
and execution are considered._

- Creating Quality Plan / Strategy doc (a living doc throughout the project), includes delivery risks, testing coverage and success criteria
- Creating/maintaining feature test case development, inventory management, and reporting
- Creating/maintaining workflow/E2E test case development, inventory management, and reporting
- Facilitating release planning and management
- Implementing Test case automation engineering: augmenting tests in Cucumber and implementing tests in harness against standing environments

### :clapper: Execution

- Follow quality best practices in all product lifecycle phases to enable testing early and often.
- Ensure cross-practice agreement on end-user facing solution behavior, ideally automatically verified using Cucumber.
- Write human-readable end-to-end tests utilizing BDD and automated testing facilities, for example using Cucumber.
- Ensure all stories describe the user value and provide thorough acceptance criteria for feature and user acceptance testing.
- Identify and then provide detailed steps how to reproduce bugs, their severity, the expected behavior, and include additional material like screenshots if necessary in bug reports.
- Use continuous integration, testing, and deployment on branches to review and test all changes prior to shipping.
