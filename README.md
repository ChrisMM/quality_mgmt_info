## :round_pushpin: Purpose

The reason for assuring quality is to
ensure timely delivery at the right quality level
and cost and to encourage a culture of quality.
QA applies in all project stages.
We apply QM to the organization practices, including QA and testing in
all practices to identify and mitigate risks with clients and projects,
and we apply QC and Product Acceptance directly into
the testing and evaluation of the output/product in the form of Agile QA-Testing.

## :pencil: Tactics

For each engagement, the Quality team helps with 5 areas
for the value and sake of both internal and external coverage:

1. Creation and maintenance of a **Quality Plan** document
2. Creation of a Risk Log and ensuring an ongoing **Risk Management** discussion
3. Evaluating the **Quality** of a project (review) working alongside all disciplines
4. Ensuring **Retrospectives** happen and identified action items are implemented
5. Creation and maintenance of a **best practices** library to guide reviews

In addition to these 5 foundational project practices, the Quality team works in product development teams focused on:

- Context-driven exploratory and Session-based testing
- Desktop, browser and mobile experience testing
- Feature and End-2-End acceptance testing
- Story hygiene and Acceptance Criteria
- Regression & Workflow testing
- QA-Testing Tools & Harnesses
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and release management
- Pair testing
- BDD and SBE test case development collaboration
- Test case management tooling
- Quality management advising
