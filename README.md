### :round_pushpin: Purpose

The reason for assuring quality is to
ensure timely delivery at the right quality level
and cost and to encourage a culture of quality.
QA applies in all project stages.
We apply QM to the organization practices, including QA and testing in
all practices to identify and mitigate risks with clients and projects,
and we apply QC and Product Acceptance directly into
the testing and evaluation of the output/product in the form of Agile QA-Testing.
