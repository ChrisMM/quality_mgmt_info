## :round_pushpin: Purpose

*The reason for assuring quality is to
ensure timely delivery at the right quality level
and cost and to encourage a culture of quality.
QA applies in all project stages.
We apply QM to the organization practices, including QA and testing in
all practices to identify and mitigate risks with clients and projects,
and we apply QC and Product Acceptance directly into
the testing and evaluation of the output (product, software system) in the form of Agile QA-Testing.*

Highlights from Wikipedia articles on [Software Quality Management and Testing](quality_wiki.md)

*The Quality team works in software product development teams with a focus on:*

- Context-driven and Charter / Session-based exploratory testing
- Desktop, browser and mobile experience testing
- Feature and End-2-End acceptance testing
- Regression & Workflow testing
- Pair testing (diagnostics)
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and release management
- Bug report details and steps
- Story hygiene and Acceptance Criteria / DoD / DoR
- QA-Testing Tools & Harnesses (automated)
- Process stops and controls
- BDD and SBE test case development collaboration
- Test case management tooling
- Change / Ticket statistics and analytics (dashboards)
- Quality management advising (including risk mitigation and process improvements)
