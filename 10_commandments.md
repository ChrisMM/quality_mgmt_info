## :books: Guidance for Agile QA

1. Test early, test often


2. Apply Agile QA


3. Embed QA on Scrum teams


4. Work very closely with Engineers and Developers (on test cases, check with them before sending tickets back, IM (Slack?) is your friend)


5. Have a clear easy to use template for bugs (Title, Expected, Actual, Steps to reproduce, Severity)


6. Have a quality plan in mind that includes a testing strategy


7. Get tagged in merge requests / PR’s so QA can know when there is a new feature test, when to
update to feature tests, etc


8. Look at needs acceptance / QA lane first thing in the morning and whenever you
have time


9. Maintain/ update build verification scripts as much as you can


10. Automate testing

_And optional: ​Bi Weekly check in / 1:1 individually with Engineers on what is going well, what could be better_
