## :notebook: Examples of QA Process

_In conversations and meetings, a good critical question often pops up asking about a delineation of what a 
QA group does in contrast to the QA processes followed by each individual practice._

_These are some examples, not all, of QA process by looking at 
[QA practices of prevention and QC activities for detection](/qm_qa_qc.md) across different contributing teams._
